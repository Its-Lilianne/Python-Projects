# EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS â€“ CAR INVENTORY ANALYSIS PROJECT

The Car Inventory Analysis project is designed to explore and analyse key insights from a dataset containing details about various cars, including their make, model, colour, mileage, price, and cost. By applying data analysis and visualisation techniques using Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the project aims to uncover trends, relationships, and key patterns within the dataset.
